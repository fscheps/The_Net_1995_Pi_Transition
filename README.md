# The Internet 1995 - "The Net" Movie Tribute

A nostalgic web recreation of the iconic hacking sequences from the 1995 movie "The Net" starring Sandra Bullock. This interactive tribute recreates the famous "π" (pi) symbol hack scene where the character Angela Bennett discovers a backdoor into a system.

## About The Project

This project is a creative homage to one of the most memorable "hacking" scenes in 90s cinema. In "The Net," Sandra Bullock's character discovers that clicking on a π symbol grants access to a hidden system, leading to a series of dramatic events.

The web recreation features:
- Authentic 90s computer interface aesthetics
- Multiple hacking sequence animations
- A login prompt that always denies access (just like in the movie!)
- Easter eggs for fans of the film
- Sound effects that enhance the experience
